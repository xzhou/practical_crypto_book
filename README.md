This book gives a practical, hands-on guidelines for software developers to write correct crypto related code. We try to give sample code so the developer can refer to them and use them in their own projects. 

Recently, many system fails because of implementation flaws. There is a gap between Cryptography theory and using them in the code. For example, we saw many Android applications fail to verify the server certificate and result in MitM attacks. Or failed to generate random strong prime numbers resulting a very small group space.
