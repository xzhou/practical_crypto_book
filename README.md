This book gives a practical, hands-on guidelines for software developers to write correct crypto related code. We try to give  code snippets that can be used in their own projects. The content in this book contains only public knowledge and does not represent the company where the authors work. 

Recently, many system fails because of implementation flaws. There is a gap between Cryptography theory and using them in the code. For example, we saw many Android applications fail to verify the server certificate and result in MitM attacks. Or failed to generate random strong prime numbers resulting a very small group space and suffers from brutal force attacks. 

We try to provide code samples that is correct to the best of our knowledge.
