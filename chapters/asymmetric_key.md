# Public Key Cryptography

Asymmetric encryption use mathematically linked key pairs to do “encryption”. Because it is slow compared to symmetric encryption, it is mostly used for key exchange.  Public key is used to verify and encrypt a message while private key is used to sign and decrypt message. Do NOT use private key to encrypt a message because it does not provide confidentiality since the public key is assumed to be publically known.
