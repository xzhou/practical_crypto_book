# Symmetric Key Encryption

Symmetric encryption uses a class of symmetric key ciphers to encrypt data. There are few symmetric encryption standard such as Blowfish and AES. For short, when in doubt which one to use, choose AES. 

## Chainning Mode

ECB, CBC, PCBC, OFB or CTR? If you are not sure which one to use, select CTR mode.However, remember don't use the same (Key, IV) pair. I also recommend CBC with random IV. 

## Padding
